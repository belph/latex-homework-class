My LaTeX Homework Document Class

Based heavily on this: https://github.com/jdavis/latex-homework-template

Place .sty files and such in $TEXMF_HOME/tex/latex/homework

You can save a `config.tex` file in the same directory to set defaults for
different values (see `sample-config.tex` for an example).
